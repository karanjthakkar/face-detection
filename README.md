The code has been tested on the following configuration:

1. Windows 7 Professional (64-bit)
2. OpenCV 2.4.2
3. Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate

The build configuration for the project in Visual Studio was x64(Release).


For users using OpenCV for the first time in a Visual Studio project, a custom property sheet has been provided "OpenCV.props"
